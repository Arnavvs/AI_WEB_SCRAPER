ai_module.py ðŸ§ 
This file is the brain of the operation. It's responsible for all communication with the Google Gemini model. It takes the raw HTML from a webpage, sends it to the AI, and gets back a structured command, like CLICK a button or EXTRACT data.

browser_engine.py ðŸ¤–
This file acts as the hands of the agent. It uses the Playwright library to launch and control a web browser. It executes the commands given by the AI moduleâ€”navigating to pages, clicking elements, and typing in forms. Its main job is to interact with the website directly.

data_handler.py ðŸ’¾
This is the filing cabinet. Once data has been scraped, this module uses the Pandas library to organize that data and save it to a local CSV file.

main.py ðŸš€
This is the orchestrator or manager. It runs the main loop that connects all the other modules. It initializes the browser_engine, gets instructions from the ai_module, tells the browser_engine to perform the actions, and finally uses the data_handler to save the results. It controls the overall workflow from start to finish.
